<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>
The Malware Analysis Service (MAS) App can authenticate in two ways. It can use an API key, which can be obtained from the MAS command line, or it can use the username and password of a MAS user. If it is using a username and password, it will request a temporary API key from the MAS instance using the supplied credentials to use for the duration of the action. If the account has a non-administrator role, such as "Analyst", then performing file detonations and getting reports will work with the username and password but not with a permanent API key.
<br>
<br>
When configuring a MAS asset, either the API key parameter or the username and password parameters must be set for the asset to work correctly. If both are set, the API key will take precedence. This will be checked during <b>test connectivity</b>. The username parameter is optional, but can be set without the password parameter, as it can be used as the default to the <b>detonate file</b> action's owner parameter.
